This is our Django website for CA229 group project 2. Our website is a Youtube Channel that has the three most popular genres and within those 3 genres (pop, country, rap) it has the four of our top 4 favorite artists and each of their most famous/our favorite youtube videos. The artists in pop are Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, and Britney Spears. The artists in rap are Kanye West, Nas, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar.
